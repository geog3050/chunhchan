My unique combination of Geography and Music has cultivated both analytical and creative skills within me. 
I believe this blend allows me to approach problems from multiple perspectives, fostering innovative solutions.

Why I'm Here🚀
I'm excited to join a team where I can contribute my skills and continue learning. 
Whether it's diving into complex spatial datasets or crafting melodies, I'm ready to collaborate and make a meaningful impact.
